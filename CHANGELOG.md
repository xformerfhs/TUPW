## [5.5.0] - 2021-05-28

### Changed
- Refactored ProtectedByteArray. It now uses a masker so there is no need to store an additional obfuscation array, which means that ShuffledByteArray is gone. The new ProtectedByteArray is the old ShuffledByteArray with a masker. This obfuscates protected data better in memory dumps.
